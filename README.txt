Jordan's notes:

Get an API and Secret Key, insert into jordank.py

https://www.binance.com/restapipub.html

https://github.com/sammchardy/python-binance

pip install python-binance

And simply run jordank.py

For Windows:
You can use git-bash portable and be mostly done with setup.

Linux:
Make sure python, git, and a shell are installed.

Todo: Figure out how to use my signature for API calls, ctrl+f through setup.py in python-binance
